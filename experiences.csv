Research Intern,Indian Institute of Science,Jun 2012 – Jul 2012,"Bangalore, India","FreeRTOS is a real time kernel on top of which embedded applications can be build to meet their hard time requirements. The kernel decides which thread should be executed by examining the priority of each thread. This feature is implemented in its source code using a large number of lists. Several API's are invoked on these particular lists. However, as per the set protocol, certain violations are observed in the source code that leads to several bugs in the implementation of FreeRTOS. In this project, we performed a static analysis of the source code using CIL and designed and implemented an algorithm to find the possible invocations that violate the protocol. In addition, context mining was performed on the source code to extract all the shared resources followed by a lock set analysis to verify whether there was an access to any of the shared resources without acquiring proper locks.

The biggest part of my job by far was the development of a universal autograder runner which multiple courses can use. The link is provided below for additional information about this project. This open-source project has been improving and gaining momentum. It is completely integrated into CS 241's infrastructure and this system produces exceptional results. It solved big problems which we had been facing for years like:
- Time-consuming autograder runs. We reduced the grading time for one assignment from 10 hours to 40 minutes.
- One student could crash the entire autograder affecting the entire class’s autograder runs. Now with Docker containers, the system is unaffected by failures like fork bombs.
- Students had to wait until midnight to receive autograder results. We build an On-Demand grading system around this API which enables students to run the autograder for themselves whenever they want to obtain instant feedback.

Software Engineering Intern,Google Internship,May 2019 – Aug 2019,"Sunnyvale, California","Worked with the gVisor team. Built an ext2/3/4 read-only filesystem driver for gVisor’s userspace kernel that will enable containers to directly talk to the underlying device without using the host filesystem driver.
This enhances security by reducing the host kernel surface being exposed to untrusted code. It also enhances performance by avoiding expensive RPCs to Gofers (trusted processes that handle filesystem operations). It performed 13x faster than existing user-space ext4 read-only drivers.
