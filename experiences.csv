Worked with the intern team to develop a dynamic, mobile-responsive website for Heroes on the Water, a nonprofit organization that arranges kayak-fishing trips for veterans. The technologies that we used included MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.Js. The project was a nationwide competition within AT&T and our team placed third overall. Our project also won Most Innovative and Best Video.

I also worked on the Dialtone Migration Project. The Dialtone server cluster centralizes the collection of information related to geography, phone numbers, modems, and XIP gateways, and automates the processing and publication of this data in a wide variety of forms. We migrated the Dialtone code base, written in C/C++ and running on Windows Server 2003, to be Linux compatible. I was assigned 30 out of 155 source files that needed to be compiled into executable files. Challenges involved translating Windows API calls to Linux calls. Common themes included socket, file, Makefile, and TCP/IP programming.

Research Assistant,Carnegie Mellon University,Mountain View,"As a full-time summer research intern to assist with a research project at the intersection of machine learning and privacy.

Project Description:
Deep learning is the state-of-art machine learning technique that is widely used for applications such as speech processing and image processing. In smart homes, a large amount of raw sensor data, including very sensitive video and audio are continuously recorded and processed by deep learning. For example, Amazon Echo collects user’s audio and recognizes voice commands via deep learning. These applications are privacy intrusive yet useful. Is there a way to get the utility of the sensor data without violating user privacy? In this project, we utilize the deep learning’s multiple-layer structure to distribute the computation on both local computing nodes and remote servers. Furthermore, we explore the space to optimize our layer distribution by training the main model and the attacker model jointly. We achieve the goal to produce good performance for data utility and preserve data privacy by making it difficult for attackers to recover the sensor data.

"Research Scientist, and Member of the Technical Staff",D. E. Shaw Research,"Mountain View, California","Designed, architected, and built major hardware and software components of Anton, a special­purpose, massively parallel supercomputer for molecular dynamics (MD). Anton has remained 30 times faster than all other platforms at MD during its first four years of operation. Anton’s speed comes from co­design that spans hardware, software, and algorithms, focusing on minimizing the latency of a single time step. I played a major role in creating Anton’s overall architecture and in designing many of Anton’s systems, including:

● Co­designing Anton’s “Flexible Subsystem”, which handles all general­purpose tasks.

● Suggesting the fusion of two existing hardware accelerators to produce the “high­throughput interaction subsystem” that is Anton’s main special­purpose hardware unit.

● Proposing, evaluating, and programming the main computational cores of the Flexible Subsystem. I designed the ISA for these cores, using a simulator and timing model that I built to explore architectural, micro­architectural, and ISA trade­offs. I also built the optimizing assembler (which performs instruction scheduling and register allocation) with which these cores are programmed.

● Replacing the proposed FFT hardware subsystem with software, saving die area while improving overall system performance.

● Modeling, simulating, and directing optimization of Anton’s performance, which exceeded our design-­time estimates.

● Managing the software simulation team and later the embedded code development team.

With Josh Fisher and Paolo Faraboschi of HP Labs, wrote “Embedded Computing: A VLIW Approach to Architecture, Compilers, and Tools”, published by Morgan­Kaufmann in 2004.

Software Engineering Ph.D. Intern,Google,Greater Los Angeles Area,"• Worked in Site Reliability Engineering for Corporate Engineering.
• Built a distributed system to improve the availability SLA of a distributed proxy service by an order of magnitude without affecting oncall responsiveness.
• The system looked for network failures behind the proxy service instances, calculated the optimal structure of the network to isolate those failures, and reconfigured network load balancers to avoid sending traffic through temporarily unusable network paths.
• The scope of the project included designing and implementing the service, end-to-end testing in coordination with the network engineers, configuring the existing Google monitoring infrastructure to monitor it, and finally handing off the live service to the oncall team.
• The main programming language used was Python along with lots of SWIGed C++ libraries. Several other proprietary languages were used as well.
• The implementation of the project consistently followed Google's extensive code review and test-driven development methodologies from ground up.

Research Intern,Tsinghua University,"Beijing City, China","Project: Learning from Labeled Features using Generalized Expectation (GE) Criteria
· Leveraged domain knowledge in the form of affinities between input features and classes for text classification
· Used labeled features directly to constrain the model’s predictions on unlabeled instances, unlike previous approaches that use labeled features to create labeled pseudo-instances.
· Expressed these constraints using GE criteria – terms in a parameter estimation objective function that express preference on values of a model expectation.
· Experimental results showed that this method outperforms heuristic approaches.

Teaching Assistant,The University of Texas at Austin,Computer Science Department,"CS378 Open Source Software Engineering

This course provides the real-world experience of contributing to an active open source project while receiving instruction and mentorship from professional software engineers. Taught by Mike McCartney, Distinguished Engineer at PayPal, students will learn modern software engineering techniques, discover the challenges of working on a distributed team, and be challenged to think through what it takes to develop a successful open source project. Lectures will consist of a broad range of software engineering topics and give students an opportunity to learn from the decades of experience from professional software engineers.

This experiential class is a continuation and expansion of work started by Jay Borenstein (Stanford, Facebook) as a part of Facebook Open Academy. In this semester, students sign up and make multiple contributions to one of 4 open source projects using Java. Students will be expected to setup their development environments and make contributions via GitHub Pull Requests. Class time will be a mixture of lecture and project discussions. Project discussions will include reviewing code and discussing challenges. Students will be expected to make contributions to open source projects. Contributions MUST be accepted by maintainers to receive full credit.

Software Engineer,Oracle,San Jose,"•Designed Oracle Billing and Revenue Management Cloud Service Reference Implementation (BRMC RI) Chef automated installation framework, which includes the configuration to install, integrate and test a BRM Cloud service. Using the open-source Chef configuration management tool, BRMC RI builds development and production environments through unattended install processes that automatically integrate each product into the overall BRM Cloud service. Once the BRMC stack has been built, BRMC RI uses open-source Cucumber to run automated acceptance tests end-to-end through the full stack. These acceptance tests are written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style to ensure that they are testing valid business use case scenarios. BRMC RI has made measurable improvements to the automation of BRM Cloud service installation and configuration processes, including, for example, an automated system that rotates passwords every three months.

•Implemented BRM Cloud Stack using Docker containers to accelerate development lifecycle, facilitate distribution and collaboration within the development team, enable version control and components reuse, minimize the deployment footprint and overhead, and assist the team as they move through multiple phases of development (Dev, Test, QA, and Production), which enabled a more agile development environment.

•Designed the packaging/release process, continuous integration and testing solution for BRM Cloud service using TeamCity and SVN version control. After the tests have been run, the results—including the stack traces of failed tests—are reported back to TeamCity where they can be viewed and reviewed.
